# sn-frontend

The sortnight frontend, using javascript and an apache to perform requests to the backend.

## Config

You will need to have [Apache httpd server](https://httpd.apache.org/) installed. 
If you're running linux, your package manager will probably have apache as an available package in that case:
```
apt-get install apache
```
Will do the trick.

Some configurations that must be present in the config file of apache. On linux it can be found in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. Don't know the location on windows.
```
DocumentRoot "/var/www"
<Directory />
    AllowOverride none
    Require all granted
</Directory>

<Directory "/var/www"> 
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

    AllowOverride none

    Require all granted
</Directory>

ProxyPass "/movie" "http://localhost:3000/movie"
ProxyPassReverse "/movie" "http://localhost:3000/movie"
ProxyPass "/search/movie" "http://localhost:3000/search/movie"
ProxyPassReverse "/search/movie" "http://localhost:3000/search/movie"
```

The "/var/www" is the sn-frontend folder where all the html,js is located. e.g "/home/phcr/Project/sn-frontend" I have symlinked my /var/www. 
```
ln -s source destination, on linux. 
e.g ln -s /home/phcr/Project/sn-frontend /var/www
```

 If you're running on linux. Make sure that apache can access your project 
```
chmod o+x folder
```
to make it readable and executable by anyone, see chmod docs for more information. You might have to make the whole home folder readable and executable 
```
chmod -R o+x ~/
```

 If you're setting up apache on windows, you're on your own. If you get it working, please write how you did it here.

Just paste these lines into the config file:
ProxyPass "/movie" "http://localhost:3000/movie"
ProxyPassReverse "/movie" "http://localhost:3000/movie"
ProxyPass "/search/movie" "http://localhost:3000/search/movie"
ProxyPassReverse "/search/movie" "http://localhost:3000/search/movie"

Inside backend, open the db.clj file and change parameters for the dataabase username and password to "root" and "".
Create database "sortnight" (in phpmyadmin, for example) and run db.sql in that database.
